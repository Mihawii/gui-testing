### Explanation of Heatmap Frames

- **Immediate Frame**: This frame captures the user's initial attention distribution upon viewing the page. It highlights where users look first.
- **Orienting Frame**: This frame shows how users adjust their focus after the initial glance, indicating areas of sustained interest.
- **Scanning Frame**: This frame represents the user's attention as they scan the page, providing insight into overall engagement and navigation patterns.

### Key Research Findings

- **Visual Hierarchy**: Effective landing pages have a strong visual hierarchy that directs attention to the most important elements, such as the call to action (https://www.seerinteractive.com/insights/ux-checklist-landing-page-design).
- **Attention Ratio**: Maintaining a 1:1 attention ratio between clickable links and conversion goals is crucial for effective user engagement (https://gojilabs.com/blog/designer-spotlight-10-best-practices-for-effective-landing-page-ux-design/).
- **Design Consistency**: Consistent design patterns reduce cognitive load and enhance user control, which is essential for conversion (https://prismic.io/blog/landing-page-optimization-best-practices).

### Decision-Ready Considerations

- Validate the effectiveness of the call to action placement.
- Assess the risks of user confusion due to scattered attention.
- Measure the impact of design changes on user engagement.
- Consider simplifying the visual hierarchy to enhance clarity.

### Caveats

- Saliency maps may not fully capture task relevance, as they focus on visual features rather than user goals (https://www.hci.uni-tuebingen.de/assets/pdf/publications/geislerETRA2020GBVS.pdf).
- Eye-tracking studies suggest that task relevance can override visual saliency, indicating the need for goal-directed design (https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1340620).

## Category 1 — Heatmaps and Metric Breakdown

### Heatmap Frames Explanation
- **Immediate**: This frame captures the first glance, showing where users look immediately upon viewing the screen.
- **Orienting**: This frame reflects the user's attention as they begin to understand the layout and content.
- **Scanning**: This frame shows how users explore the screen in more detail, often looking for specific information.

### Metrics Table
| Metric          | Value  | Plain Meaning                                      |
|-----------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Alignment       | 0.0    | No alignment with intended focus areas.            |
| Clarity         | 0.47   | Moderate clarity; users may struggle to find info. |
| Decay           | 0.65   | Attention fades quickly; users lose interest fast. |
| Dominance       | 0.14   | No single element strongly captures attention.     |
| Focal Points    | 31     | Many areas compete for attention.                  |
| Focus           | 0.01   | Very low focus; attention is scattered.            |
| Fragmentation   | 1.0    | Highly fragmented attention; no clear path.        |
| Intent Overlap  | 0.0    | No overlap with user intent.                       |

### What This Means on This Screenshot
- Attention is scattered across multiple areas.
- Users may find it difficult to locate key features.
- The visual hierarchy is not effectively guiding user focus.
- Over-attention areas may distract from important content.
- The design does not align with user expectations.
- Users might miss critical AI features due to low clarity.
- The interface needs better alignment with user tasks.
- Immediate attention is not captured effectively.
- Scanning patterns do not align with intended user paths.

### Heatmap Legend Thresholds
- **Gray (<0.15)**: Areas largely ignored.
- **Green (0.15 to 0.65)**: Areas with moderate attention.
- **Red (>=0.65)**: Areas with excessive attention, potentially distracting.

## Category 3 — Research Synthesis for Founders and Enterprise Leaders

### Key Research Findings
- Users often scan in F-patterns or Z-patterns, which should inform the placement of key elements (source: [Interaction Design Foundation](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/visual-hierarchy?srsltid=AfmBOootcPA5umi9kRu-9BT-Kr-PG6_d3zywUDCUqwMJiWak1Xywfj5Z)).
- Visual hierarchy is crucial for guiding user attention effectively (source: [Interaction Design Foundation](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/visual-hierarchy?srsltid=AfmBOootcPA5umi9kRu-9BT-Kr-PG6_d3zywUDCUqwMJiWak1Xywfj5Z)).

### Voice of Reddit
- **Thread**: "Tips: create and test emails locally with maildev"  
  **URL**: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/17x0hdy/tips_create_and_test_emails_locally_with_maildev/)  
  **Excerpt**: "Maildev will catch all the emails sent by the app and show them in a web UI, just like any real email client."
- **Thread**: "How to test email sending with django-mailer?"  
  **URL**: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/yrd3su/how_to_test_email_sending_with_djangomailer/)  
  **Paraphrase**: Discussion on using django-mailer for email queue management.
- **Thread**: "Guide to URLs"  
  **URL**: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/djangolearning/comments/pn1qvb/guide_to_urls/)  
  **Paraphrase**: Users discuss understanding and using URLs in Django.

### Decision-ready Considerations
- Validate the placement of AI features to align with user scanning patterns.
- Measure user success in finding and using key features.
- Assess risks of user frustration due to unclear navigation paths.
- Consider redesigning the interface to enhance clarity and focus.

### Caveats
- Saliency maps may not fully capture task relevance, as users may focus on less salient but more relevant features (source: [OSTI](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1340620)).
